            I am a passionate engineering student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Entertainment Engineering and Design.
            In the semesters I've spent so far studying at UNLV, I've created many projects I am proud of that I'd love to share with the world!
            My current interests lie in scenic design and projection mapping, and I aspire to one day create my own immersive experience
            so I can combine storytelling and technical innovation to bring joy to my community!
            <br><br>
            My decision to become an entertainment engineer comes from my love for art and technology.
            Since I was a child, art has been my passion.
            Hobbies like drawing, painting, sculpting, and embroidery came like second nature to me.
            I collected new hobbies every time I watched someone else do something cool.
            In high school, I found a passion for coding in the three years that I took C++, Java, and web development classes.
            I quickly realized that art and technology are not that different from each other.
            I could use both as forms of expression to create something from nothing&mdash;the possibilities were endless.
            I look forward to expanding and diversifying my skill set through new opportunities!
            <br><br>
            Outside of school, I love to endulge myself in various forms of art and music!
            My full list of hobbies is extensive, but my favorites would be
            playing the guitar (especially my pride and joy, Kirby the Telecaster), journaling, gardening, and playing cozy video games.
