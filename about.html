        <p>
            I am a passionate engineering student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Entertainment Engineering and Design.
            In the semesters I've spent so far studying at UNLV, I've created many projects I am proud of that I'd love to share with the world!
            In terms of what the future holds for me as an aspiring engineer, I am currently interested in scenic design and projection mapping and aspire to one day create my own immersive experience, where I can combine storytelling and technical innovation.
            I am eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities that will allow me to further develop my diverse skill set and continue exploring the intersection of arts and engineering to bring joy to my community!
            <br><br>
            How did I come to be an entertainment engineer? Since I was a child, art has been my passion.
            Hobbies like drawing, painting, sculpting, or embroidery came like second nature to me.
            I loved going through my mom's makeup drawers to look for pencils that could be art supplies,
            or going through my brothers' closets to find old toys to tinker and build mini rollercoasters with.
            In high school, I found a passion for coding in the three years that I took C++ and Java classes.
            I quickly realized that art and technology are not that different from each other.
            I could use both as forms of expression, and the possibilities are endless.
            At the same time, I also took three web design and development classes which were
            easily some of the best classes I have taken in school! I learned to be proficient with Adobe Photoshop and
            comfortable with developing web pages.
            Now, I can create pretty websites and easily share them with the world, without any boundaries.
            <br><br>
            Outside of school, I love to endulge myself in various forms of art and music!
            My full list of hobbies is extensive, but my favorites would be
            playing the guitar, drawing in my journal, gardening with my indoor plants, and playing cozy video games.
